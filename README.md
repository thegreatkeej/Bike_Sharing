## Summary

### Sugestions
Three things stand out in this analysis: 
1) Citibikes main customers are male. Des Moines could capitalize on marketing to this 
demographic or they can develope a maketing strategy to get women and undeclared genders
interested.

2) Subscription services greatly increase rideship. This would be a great thing to incentivize.

3) Further analysis should be done to understand why certain starting locations have higher
volumes of customers. The crude map in the data only shows rough landmarks (water ways, Central Park). What was noticiable 
was that the highest concentrations of ridership occured near water ways. 

### 6A and 6B) Bikes Potentially Needing Repair
